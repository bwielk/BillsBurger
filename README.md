BillsBurger is a program that deals with processing orders in a fictional burger restaurant. 
Tools used: EclipseIDE
Language: Java

Some Java features used in the software structure: EnumMaps, HashMaps, BigDecimal, inheritance, interfaces, casting(subcasting)

MVP

- the restaurant offers three types of burgers - a <classic> Burger that accepts up to 4 additions with an extra charge for each addition; FitBurger that accepts up to 2 additions and DeluxeBurger that doesn't accept additions but it always comes with a Drink and Chips in a package.
- the Till adds a suitable number of additions to a particular Burger type
- the Till adds Drink and Chips as separate products to a transaction
- the restaurant Till calculates the transaction and processes Burgers, Drink and Chips in a transaction
- the restaurant Till accepts Vouchers
- the restaurant Till releases a Receipt after every transaction (working on making it printable)
- other additional functionalities - more to be implemented

My planning process: some sketches of the potential data flow and classes to build

The TDD approach while building the software was contantly in use:
